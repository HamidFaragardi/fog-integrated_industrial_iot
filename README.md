#### An Optimization Framework For Fog-Integrated Industrial IoT

It is an optimization framework to design a fog-integrated industrial IoT system which can be used as a foundation for deployment of a Smart Factory. This gets a lot of information about system specifications such as number of end-nodes, number of fog nodes, the processing capacity of fog nodes, number and size of each industrial IoT application as inputs and produces several design decisions such as placement of the applications among end-nodes, fog nodes, local servers, and the cloud. To read more about the concept behind this framework please refer to this paper:

#### How To Run
Run with java command and select one of the benchmarks (Small, Medium or Large).

```java - jar fog.jar```
